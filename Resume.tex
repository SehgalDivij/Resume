								\begin{itemize} % \item[] prevents a bullet from appearing
									\item[] Involved in Planning, Market Analysis and Product Development.
									\item[] Product: Video Analytics for Retail Sector. Following are my areas of contribution on the product:
									\begin{itemize}
										\item Developed a Facial Recognition/Clustering module for clustering unknown faces and extracting representatives features for each individual. A Deep Neural Network was used for Facial Feature Generation and online clustering was achieved through an incrementally updating clusters obtained by the DBSCAN Clustering algorithm in realtime.
										\item Implemented person re-identification module for in-store customer tracking.
										\item Prototyped and developed Beta Version as a web based interface aiming for easier accessibility and visibility.
